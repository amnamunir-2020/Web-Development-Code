		Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and <!-- software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.Students often wonder what the differences are between computer science and  information systems. Both deal with computers but they focus on different technological aspects. Before choosing a degree to follow, it’s important to understand what road each degree sets you down. Here’s the break down of each degree and what they specialize in.omputer Science focuses on technical and theoretical programs. A degree in computer science provides students with knowledge of computer operating systems, coding, computer networking, computer architecture, and database design. Computer science has roots in math, physics, and electrical engineering.Some people feel overwhelmed with the amount of math this degree requires but students who are comfortable with mathematics or have previous experience with it have  few problems with it. The nice thing about a Computer Science Degree is that pairs well with a wide variety of degrees like woman studies, religion, chemistry, biology, and much more.With a Computer Information Systems Degree, students focus on how to apply technology to business. Computer information systems takes technology and places it in a commercial setting. In addition to learning how technology works, students learn how to use the technology to benefit a company. The reviews for this degree are mixed. Some people enjoy that many topics are covered, while others become frustrated by the lack of focus on one particular subject. A computer information systems course includes business courses and managerial communications, as well as coding and other tech skills. This degree goes well with most business related majors and degrees in arts, graphics design, and communication.design.
